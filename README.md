3. Ensure the React components are well-structured and follow best practices.
4. Make the page responsive and compatible with modern web browsers.
5. Pay attention to detail, including spacing, fonts, colors, and overall layout fidelity.
6. Optionally, you can utilize any additional libraries or frameworks if you believe they will aid in achieving the desired result.
